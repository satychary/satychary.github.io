Looks GREAT, EASY, COMPLETE!!! Better than my slidy, and even remarkjs etc.. Seems PDFable and so on, can do EMBEDDING (iframe!), images too, and links of course.. Question: touch swipable? Finding out :) YES!!

Going to use this for EVERYTHING (starting w/ CS103 and CS585, in spring 2016 [now!])..

Templates/intros:
* boilerplate.html
* presentation.
* saty_1.
* introduction/deck.
* introduction/introduction_customizable.
* CS103, CS585 notes from spring '16
