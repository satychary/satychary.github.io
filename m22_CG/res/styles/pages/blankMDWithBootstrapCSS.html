<!-- only ONE xmp section will render, so don't have multiples; ONLY customization is the 'theme' - look in 0.2/themes for alt names, eg. united (this came as the demo one), amelia, journal, readable -->
<!-- what look good:
* flatly - probably 2nd best..
* cosmo - clean
* readable - simple, pretty b/w, makes H1 ALL uppercase!!
* simplex - tall and thin
* slate: sort of like my 'forever' smartcg css!!
* spacelab - clean, elegant, minimal, pretty - Becky's fav!
* united - modern - probably the best :)
* yeti - thinnish; yucky top-menu
* cyborg - pretty but navbar can't be 'right'

* bootstrap: chunky but good, no 'right' navbar
* default: nice text but black menubar (not 'bad' though)
-->

# Text

## Our textbook is ['C++ For Everyone (2nd Ed)'](http://www.amazon.com/C-Everyone-Cay-S-Horstmann/dp/0470920920). You can either buy a used/new printed version, or buy/rent an electronic one. Do make sure you have access to the book, you'll need it.

#Sites (free, online material)
##C++ is a mature, widely-used language, which means there are numerous pages that are devoted to teaching it, discussing issues related to it, etc. Below is a small sampler.

###[LearnCpp.com](http://www.learncpp.com/) is an excellent site, with extremely well-written mini 'tutorials' on a huge number of C++ topics.
###[C++ FAQ](http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq/) - very thorough "go to" reference.
###[C++ reference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp) - another good reference.
###[C++ Tutorial](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c++-tutorial.html) - a well-organized site, with detailed notes on every topic.

###[C++ in 7 pages](https://www.howtoforge.com/learning-c-cplusplus-step-by-step) : a fast-paced intro, uses lots of C (not C++) constructs.

###[Another C++ course](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wjk/C++Intro/CourseStructure.html) : clearly written, with plenty of program fragments and diagrams.

###A lengthy set of C++ topics: http://www.informit.com/guides/guide.aspx?g=cplusplus
