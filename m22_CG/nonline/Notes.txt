Dear Saty,

Thanks for your email. Please do take some time to have a good rest as well even though under this extremely busy schedule. The start date could be adjusted to 9th July, the 7 sessions will be on 7/9, 7/16, 7/23, 7/30, 8/6, 8/13, 8/20. It could be on your Friday nights, then it will be on Saturday morning at Beijing time. As for the topic, could we start computer graphics first, since we already have a program on data science scheduled to open in the coming summer? There are several students who came to us mentioning that they are extremely interested in the topic of computer graphics. We would really appreciate it if you could send us the syllabus on that topic. 

Thanks for sparing your time to read the message. I will send you the formal contract through hello sign for you to sign later today.

Regards,
Katrina
