Edit the HTML, add in pics (eg schedule snapshot) etc... ALWAYS include these 5 sections, in order:
* overview, incl a note on 'extras'
* prereq desc
* topics [incl textbk]
* course structure [grading %s, delivery etc]
* qns?


Tips:
* rotate lec sched sideways for a nice scrgrab
* after including it here, adjust the width % to look nice - eg 40%
* play w/ SCALE (NOT margins!) to make sure a sched topic won't get sliced :)
