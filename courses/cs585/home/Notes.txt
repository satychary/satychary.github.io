ForSOC/ is exactly what it's for - to put up, in the SOC :)

Edit the HTML, add in pics (eg schedule snapshot) etc... Include sections on:
* overview, incl a note on 'extras'
* prereq desc
* topics
* grading 
* textbook

Proper syntax for video emb (in 2023, 2024!):
<br><video width="570" controls autoplay loop muted>
  <source src="clips/Adverity.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

Hidden span: <br>
<span style="color:white;">OMG: www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed9fS5gDlNI</span>

Can preview pics/ in FC (not Win Explorer!) - what I like, then enter it in index.html :)
