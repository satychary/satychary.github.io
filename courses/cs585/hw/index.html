<!-- only ONE xmp section will render, so don't have multiples; ONLY customization is the 'theme' - look in 0.2/themes for alt names, eg. united (this came as the demo one), amelia, journal, readable -->
<!-- what look good:
* flatly - probably 2nd best..
* cosmo - clean
* readable - simple, pretty b/w, makes H1 ALL uppercase!!
* simplex - tall and thin
* slate: sort of like my 'forever' smartcg css!!
* spacelab - clean, elegant, minimal, pretty - Becky's fav!
* united - modern - probably the best :)
* yeti - thinnish; yucky top-menu
* cyborg - pretty but navbar can't be 'right'

* bootstrap: chunky but good, no 'right' navbar
* default: nice text but black menubar (not 'bad' though)
-->

<!-- Inside the xmp, *can* have classic md, html, links for such mixed markup), etc. -->

##**Assignments**

###The course will have <b>four</b> assignments [and POSSIBLY an additional one at my discretion - <b>you SHOULD NOT submit it - it carries NO credit AT ALL - we will NOT grade it even if you send it to us</b>]. Assignments are to be completed **individually** [no collaboration allowed!] and without using AI. Consult each HW's description for expectations regarding submissions - format, content, style, READMEs etc. Assigments need to be submitted via D2L (do My Tools -> Assignments), any emailed submissions will simply be ignored.

###Late submissions policy: 10% penalty per day after the deadline. Please plan your use of time wisely, don't ask for extensions because you have another project deadline, upcoming interviews, needing to travel, etc. [giving you an extension would be unfair to others who might have had similar time pressures, but did manage to get everything done].

###Regrading policy: if you think that your work deserves a re-grading, please talk to your grader - if the grader resolves the issue (by pointing out what you did wrong/missed.. and therefore not giving you more points, or, giving you points), you're done; if the grader is unable to resolve the dispute, you need to see a TA about it; if the TA is also unable to settle the matter, then (and only then) should you contact the professor (me!) (who has the final say). **You MUST bring up issues within 7 days of getting your HW score - late requests WILL NOT be considered!**

###Homework links will get published below this sentence, ongoing, when it's time for each.
####&bull; <a href="HW1/index.html">HW1</a> - assigned 7/11/25, due 7/16/25 by 11:59PM
####&bull; <a href="HW2/index.html">HW2</a> - assigned 7/29/25, due 8/2/25 by 11:59PM
<div style="height:1px;border:1px solid #BBBBBB;"/>



##**Exams**

###There will be TWO exams: a midterm exam and a final [see the schedule for dates+times]. **Please plan accordingly - these dates are NOT negotiable!.** I cannot accommodate requests for 'alternative' arrangements AT ALL, sorry.

###If you get a low score in an exam, please do not ask for 'extra assignments' to 'make up'! Giving (just) you a chance to raise your score would be unfair to others who also deserve similar consideration.

###Please talk to a TA/grader if you have questions related to the above, or contact me.


###<a href="m25_s/s25_mt_exam.pdf">This</a> is a sample midterm [the actual one from spring!], <a href="m25_s/s25_mt_ans.pdf">these</a> are the rubrics for it.

<div style="height:1px;border:1px solid #BBBBBB;"/>

##**Letter grade**

###The following weightage scheme will be used in determining letter grades for the course at the end of the term:  

###&bull; assignments: 40% (4*10%)
###&bull; exams: 60% [midterm: 30%, final: 30%]
###&bull; attendance: -5 points for EACH 'discovered' absence  

###Your final letter grade will be based upon your total % score according to the scheme shown above, the highest total in the class, and the mean score for the class - in other words, <b>relatively</b>, based on a score distribution 'curve' [note - curving does **not** mean that scores will be increased by adding or multiplying some 'curving factor']; <50% will fetch you an 'F', though [regardless of the grading curve]. 

###**Your final weighted score will NOT AUTOMATICALLY BE ROUNDED UP; IT \*COULD\* BE, AT THE DISCRETION OF THE PROFESSOR (ME!).** In other words: if you get an 86.2 or 86.6 (as an example), you can't EXPECT it to get turned into 87 -  **I might** turn 86.6 into 87, or even turn 86.2 to an 87, but you **cannot expect/assume/demand** that the rounding up take place. 

<div style="height:1px;border:1px solid #BBBBBB;"/>

##**Course 'flow'**
###As you know, there are lots of 'pieces' in a course, each with a 'who what when' - knowing these helps set expectations for all of us. <a href="https://bytes.usc.edu/~saty/courses/shared/flow/index.html">Here</a> is how we'll run the course. That said, there might be small deviations (eg. delays) here and there, so please go with the flow - I do promise that we will get through everything, and resolve things as best as we can :)
<div style="height:1px;border:1px solid #BBBBBB;"/>

##**Cheating (AGAIN: DON'T DO IT!!)**

###If you are caught plagiarizing or cheating in other ways, your grade will suffer FOR SURE - you have been WARNED. There cannot be any leniency, second chances, forgiveness, none at all. This is a SERIOUS matter that you need to take seriously, ie. be sure that ALL your work (hw projects, exam answers) are 100% your own.

###As mentioned earlier, USC takes such violations seriously... Again, there is too much at stake - **JUST DON'T DO IT**.
