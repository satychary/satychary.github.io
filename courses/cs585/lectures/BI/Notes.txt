Data Lake vs Operational Database
Since they both store untransformed data, I was wondering that is there any difference between them.
A data lake would be a superset of sorts, of a traditional operational DB - because the data lake would ingest streaming data that is structured as well as semi-structured (eg tweets, emails, server logs, Instagram likes, etc), directly into a cloud, Hadoop environment, with continuous or on-demand analytics.
PS: To put it differently, in a Data Lake there's no ETL (ie no "schema-on-write" loading using a star or snowflake schema), and, it's not just for structured data.

NICE: for discussions, use #3, #4 schemas!
